4. - Accessible here: https://youtu.be/D3hhKZ682Ms | The final presentation, summarizing many technical aspects to our project.
5. - Accessible here: https://youtu.be/ekrKrGUiqtw | The final demo of our working final product & additional note, the final measurements for both SNR & distortion were not recorded correctly until after our video, the SNR of 40dB and THD of less than 5% with good audio quality.

The polyphonic hybrid music synthesizer NepTune is capable of creating multiple oscilations digitally, modulating them with analog circuitry according to user specficiations, and mixing four simultaneous oscillations into audio signals that are then outputted through our series of audio-designed components.
This project was primarily worked on between May 2025 - Novemeber 2025 and consisted of 4 teammates & I meeting regularly, planning, strategizing and committing to working until the project was complete in time for our graudation fall 2025.
My contributions to this project primarily were the analog circuitry involved signal modulation, filtering, amplification, mixing, as well as power distribution.
I worked closely with my teammates and gained experience working with microproessors such as the ESP32 and STM32, with output amplifiers and with LFOs (Low-frequency Oscillators).
Additionally, working on this project helped me expand my skills with:
* Soldering (0805 mostly)
* KiCad PCB software design
* Programming & Debugging Microprocessors & ICs
* Coordinating with a group on shared goals & division of labor
* Debugging and testing with Power supply, Oscilloscope, Multimeter, Waveform generator, and with simulations
* Crimping and wire routing
* Comprehension and Research involving technical documentation including schematics and data sheets
All of this experience has given me my closest interactions with real industry equivalents and has provided a wealth of knowledge on many important skills for a growing Electrical Engineer.
